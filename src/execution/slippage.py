"""
MOMENTUM-X Slippage Model

### ARCHITECTURAL CONTEXT
Node ID: execution.slippage
Graph Link: docs/memory/graph_state.json → "execution.slippage"

### RESEARCH BASIS
Implements Almgren & Chriss (2001) square-root market impact model:
    Impact = σ × √(order_shares / daily_volume)

Resolves H-009: Paper trading has infinite liquidity and binary fills.
This model provides synthetic slippage for realistic backtesting.

### CRITICAL INVARIANTS
1. Volume impact scales with √(participation_rate).
2. Spread cost = half the bid-ask spread (crossing the book).
3. Combined slippage = spread + volume impact + fixed costs.
4. Zero volume → 5% max slippage cap (safety).
5. Sell-side slippage reduces effective price.

### USAGE
```python
model = SlippageModel()
est = model.estimate(price=10.0, order_shares=5000, daily_volume=500_000, volatility=0.04, bid=9.95, ask=10.05)
adjusted_price = est.effective_price
```
